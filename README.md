## Introduction
This is a demo repository from a "newbie" in GitHub.

## The story of this project
When I was new to GitHub, I first created this repository (based on the GitHub starter guide) to do some simple code. And then I spend some time to dig in this worldwide app / website and I found many other functions of GitHub (mostly self-discover). Then I update a new version of this project and use more hidden functions. Now, I made a small project on GitHub and play some code in it.
